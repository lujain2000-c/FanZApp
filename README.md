In this project, I have organized the files following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, and I used Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
Thir is three screens:
1- main 
2- Mohamad sala details
3- Cristiano Ronaldo details
you can navigate to player details if click on Mohamad sala or Cristiano Ronaldo card in the main screen.
